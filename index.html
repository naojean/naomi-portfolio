  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm Naomi Briggs, a Data Science and Marketing major at the University of Oregon. I’m passionate about the intersection of culture, media, and strategy, specifically how storytelling, design, and data come together to shape the way brands connect with people. I'm currently exploring opportunities where I can combine analytical thinking with creative insight to make a real impact.</p>

  <h3>Data Science Case Study: Fertility Rates Decline</h3>

  <h3>Data Analysis Project: Netflix Movies and TV Shows</h3>
  <p>Analyzed a large dataset of Netflix film and series releases to uncover patterns in seasonal release timing and differences in content strategy. Cleaned and prepared the data using Python and Pandas, created new categorical variables, and separated titles by type for clearer comparison. Used grouped summaries and visualizations to identify key insights, including a strong winter spike in TV show releases and a more balanced year-round release pattern for movies. Interpreted these trends through a marketing lens, explaining how Netflix aligns content drops with seasonal viewer behavior. This project strengthened my skills in data preparation, visualization, and translating analytical findings into strategic insights.</p>

  <section id="culture">
    <h2>Culture & Data</h2>
    <p>I am a firm believer in the notion that culture is the essence of marketing. From viral moments to subtle shifts in certain trends and aesthetics, it drives how people connect with brands. Through data, we can translate that cultural energy into marketing strategies: understanding trends, measuring sentiment, and identifying what truly resonates. I'm fascinated by how brands interpret this feedback loop in real-time, and how digital spaces constantly reshape what “relevance” means.</p>
